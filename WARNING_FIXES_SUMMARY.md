# Warning Fixes Applied to BharatBench Project

## Summary of Issues Resolved

This document summarizes the warnings and issues that were identified and fixed in the BharatBench project notebooks.

## 1. Fixed Issues in 3_CNN.ipynb

### Import Issues Fixed

- **Duplicate imports**: Removed duplicate `import tensorflow as tf` statements
- **Mixed import patterns**: Consolidated all TensorFlow/Keras imports to use consistent `tensorflow.keras` pattern
- **Import organization**: Reorganized imports for better readability and to avoid version conflicts

### Path Issues Fixed

- **Hardcoded paths**: Replaced absolute hardcoded paths (`D:/VSCODE_Works/BharatBench/`) with relative paths
- **Directory structure**: Created `models/` directory for storing trained models
- **String formatting**: Fixed raw string and backslash issues in file paths

### Error Handling Added

- **File operations**: Added try-catch blocks around dataset loading and model loading operations
- **Model loading**: Added checks for file existence before loading models
- **Informative messages**: Added descriptive error messages to help with debugging

## 2. Fixed Issues in Other Notebooks

### 1_climatology_persistence.ipynb

- Fixed hardcoded dataset path
- Added error handling for dataset loading

### 2_Linear_Regression.ipynb

- Fixed hardcoded dataset path  
- Added error handling for dataset loading

## 3. Best Practices Implemented

1. **Relative Paths**: Use relative paths instead of absolute hardcoded paths
2. **Error Handling**: Always wrap file operations in try-catch blocks
3. **Consistent Imports**: Use consistent import patterns throughout the project
4. **Directory Structure**: Organize files in appropriate directories (models/, figures/, etc.)
5. **Warning Suppression**: Proper placement of warning filters at the beginning of notebooks

## 4. Directory Structure Created

```text
BharatBench_fork/
├── models/                     # For storing trained models (.hdf5 files)
├── figures/                    # For plots and visualizations  
├── csv_data/                   # CSV data files
├── *.ipynb                     # Jupyter notebooks
├── *.nc                        # NetCDF data files
└── README.md
```

## 5. Common Warning Sources to Watch For

1. **Deprecated APIs**: TensorFlow/Keras API changes over versions
2. **Mixed import patterns**: Using both `keras` and `tensorflow.keras`  
3. **Hardcoded paths**: Absolute file paths that don't work across systems
4. **Missing error handling**: File operations without try-catch blocks
5. **Duplicate imports**: Multiple imports of the same module

## 6. Recommendations for Future Development

1. Always use relative paths for data and model files
2. Implement proper error handling for all file operations  
3. Keep imports organized and consistent
4. Use environment variables for system-specific configurations
5. Test notebooks on different systems/environments
6. Regularly update dependencies to avoid deprecation warnings

## 7. Files Modified

- `3_CNN.ipynb`: Major fixes for imports, paths, and error handling
- `1_climatology_persistence.ipynb`: Dataset path fixes
- `2_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Dataset path fixes
- Created: `models/` directory for organizing trained models

These fixes should significantly reduce warnings and make the notebooks more robust and portable across different environments.
